      Fixed the handling of large packets. The internal buffer was not being
        handled properly and large packets would be terminated.
      Added serveral tests, thanks lestrrat for providing the basic tests.

      Removed the test for pod-coverage. I don't use that style for writting
        documentation. Fixes a problem reported by the perl testers.
